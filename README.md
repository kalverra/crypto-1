# Crypto 1

My notes on [Stanford's Cryptography 1 course presented by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto). This is more meant for my own personal understanding and chronicling, it's not really intended to be consumed by others. You'd probably have better luck doing the course yourself.

Things to look at after this:

* [Crypto 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto2)
* A course on [applied cryptogrophy](https://toc.cryptobook.us/)
